# HolaCloud Site

This is the content generator for the [hola.cloud](https://hola.cloud/) site and landing page.

It contains all the static files served from [hola.cloud](https://hola.cloud) plus the sources.

## How to run

As simple as:

```sh
make run
```

It will start the service on the default port (http://localhost:8080).


## How to edit the site

All content is under `src/` folder. To understand how multilingual and templating things work, please see the project [github.com/fulldump/holadoc](https://github.com/fulldump/holadoc)

Remember to build the site each time if you want to see how all looks like.
